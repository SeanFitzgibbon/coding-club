# Session 3

## Goal

Recap the material from the first few weeks and give the students an opporunity to apply what they have learnt to create a project of their own creation.  If time, introduce loops and functions.  If not time, loops and functions can be introduced during the subsequent robotics weeks.

## Schedule

1. Recap slides/discussion
2. 30-40 mins make their own `MakeCode` project from scratch.  They should try and include constructs from the first three sessions:
    - Inputs & outputs
    - Events & event-handlers
    - Variables
    - Conditionals
3. Work through offline activities for remainder of session:
    - Loops
    - Functions
