# Session 3

## Goal

Develop further understanding of conditionals, variables, and memory.

## Schedule

1. 30-40 mins working through `MakeCode` tutorial:
    - `Clap Lights`
2. Work through offline activities for remainder of session:
    - Conditionals
    - Variables and memory

## Slides

[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EkHBuciU-tDb2fQFzPt7B3m3n3kf2HDl9J5W9gDDj7o/edit#slide=id.gf91c9cecfe_0_134](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EkHBuciU-tDb2fQFzPt7B3m3n3kf2HDl9J5W9gDDj7o/edit#slide=id.gf91c9cecfe_0_134)

## Offline activities

### Variables

- Discuss how a variable is a container, like a box, that contains a value
- A variable has a name.
- Values can be of different types, depending on the language.
- Variables can be manipulated without know the value, e.g. add 1 to the `score` when your football team kicks a goal.
- The are some slides above that visually depict variables as a box, along with `block` and `python` examples.

> This activity worked well, but it would be good to find a way to make it more interactive.


### Conditionals: the if then else game

Construct an `if` statement of the form, or use block notation:

```
if (condition):
    Have a haribo!
```

Select a student and if they can create a `condition` that is `True`, then they can have a haribo.

Construct an `if` statement of the form:

```
if (condition):
    Do a silly dance
else:
    Have a haribo!
```

Select a student and if they can create a `condition` that is `False`, then they can have a haribo, or else they have to do a silly dance.

Construct an `if` statement of the form:

```
if (condition1):
    Do a silly dance
else if (condition2):
    Have a haribo!
else:
    Sing out loud
```

Select a student and if they can create a `condition1` that is `False` and a `condition2` that is `True`, then they can have a haribo, or else they have to do a silly dance or sing out loud as appropriate.

> This activity seemed quite easy for the yr 5/6 kids.  Perhaps could include some nested if statements...
