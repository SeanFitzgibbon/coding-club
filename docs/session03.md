    - `Clap Lights`
2. Work through offline activities for remainder of session:
    - Conditionals
    - Variables and memory

## Slides

## Offline activities

### Conditionals: the if then else game

Construct an if statement of the form, or use block notation:

```
if (condition):
    Have a haribo!
```

Select a student and if they can create a `condition` that is `True`, then they can have a haribo.

Construct an if statement of the form:

```
if (condition):
    Do a silly dance
else:
    Have a haribo!
```

Select a student and if they can create a `condition` that is `False`, then they can have a haribo, or else they have to do a silly dance.

Construct an if statement of the form:

```
if (condition1):
    Do a silly dance
else if (condition2):
    Have a haribo!
else:
    Sing out loud
```

Select a student and if they can create a `condition1` that is `False` and a `condition2` that is `True`, then they can have a haribo, or else they have to do a silly dance or sing out loud as appropriate.

### Variables and memory

TBD
