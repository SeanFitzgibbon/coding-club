# Coding and Robotics Club

This repository contains materials and resources for the Yr 5/6 Coding and Robotics Club.

The Coding & Robotics Club is an opportunity for Year 5 and 6 children to develop their coding skills in a fun and interactive way.  

We use the awesome BBC micro:bit platform to create a range of projects from a simple flashing heart through to complex robot cars that can drive through obstacle courses.  

## Plan

The rough plan for the initial 10-week program:

- Weeks 1-4: Basics of coding using the BBC micro:bit
- Weeks 5-8: Robotics using the Kitronik:move robotic car kit
- Weeks 9-10: Robocup
