# Session 2

## Goal

Develop further understanding of inputs/outputs, as well as events and event-handling.

## Schedule

1. 30-40 mins working through `MakeCode` tutorials:
    - `Name Tag`
    - `Smiley Buttons`
    - `Dice`
    - `Pet Hamster`
2. Work through offline activities for remainder of session:
    - Inputs/outputs
    - Events/event-handlers


## Slides

## Offline activities

### Inputs/outputs

> This activity/game was enjoyed by the yr 5/6 children, but took > 10 mins.

This is intended to be a whole group activity. 

Instructor shows pictures (on screen or printed; the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14AQxra3NbUsyzz-y08x4K19MviHBFN3LyIstKVovPck/edit?usp=sharing) contain appropriate pictures) of input/output devices and gets the children to classify them as input/output.  Encourage discussion of why.  Also include the devices that are both.

Output devices:
1. monitor
2. speaker
3. LEDs
4. Motors

Input devices:
1. microphone
2. keyboard
3. mouse
4. micro:bit buttons
5. ultrasonic sensor

Input/Output devices:
1. Bluetooth radios
2. Touch screen
3. micro:bit pins

### Events/event-handlers

> We ran out of time to do this activity so it was pushed to the start of session 03.

This is intended to be a whole group activity. 

Get 4 children to volunteer, 1 child to be the micro:bit, and 3 children to be event-handlers (button press, loud noise, shake).

The event-handlers must decide what task/action they will perform when the are activated (e.g. jump, yell, spin around, do a star jump, mouse click, etc.).  The event-handlers must then register themselves with the micro:bit.  The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14AQxra3NbUsyzz-y08x4K19MviHBFN3LyIstKVovPck/edit?usp=sharing) contain images of event handlers with empty tasks/actions which can be used to add the chosen task/action too.  

Remaining children to line up as events (e.g. loud noise, shake, button press, sensor dectection) in an event queue.  As each child gets to the front of the queue, they signal their event, and the micro:bit has to instruct an appropriate event-handler who must in turn carry out the task.

Guide children through examples of:
1. event-handler being registered with micro:bit
2. events occuring and micro:bit activating event-handlers
3. explain how nothing happens if there is no handler for the event

Opportunity to also explain how programs are sequential.
