# Session 2

## Goal

Develop further understanding of inputs/outputs, as well as events and event-handling.

The plan is to:
1. 30-40 mins working through `MakeCode` tutorials:
    - `Name Tag`
    - `Smiley Buttons`
    - `Dice`
    - `Pet Hamster`
2. Work through offline activities for remainder of session:
    - Inputs/outputs
    - Events/event-handlers

## Offline activities

### Inputs/outputs

This is intended to be a whole group activity. 

Instructor shows pictures (on screen or printed) of input/output devices and gets the children to classify them as input/output.  Encourage discussion of why.  Also include the devices that are both.

Output devices:
1. monitor
2. speaker
3. LEDs
4. Motors

Input devices:
1. microphone
2. keyboard
3. mouse
4. micro:bit buttons
5. ultrasonic sensor

Input/Output devices:
1. Bluetooth radios
2. Touch screen
3. micro:bit pins

### Events/event-handlers

This is intended to be a whole group activity. 

Get 7 children to volunteer, 3 to be assigned to be events (button press, loud clap, mouse click), 1 child to be the micro:bit, and 2 children to be event-handlers (button press, loud clap).

Guide children through examples of:
1. event-handler being registered with micro:bit
2. events occuring and micro:bit activating event-handlers
3. explain how nothing happens if there is no handler for the event

Opportunity to also explain how programs are sequential.
